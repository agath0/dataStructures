As graph is a non linear data structure there are two 
suggested traversal metrics like that of
Breadth first search
Depth first search
 

Breadth first search is similar to level order of a 
binary tree	


-visiting a vertex
-exploring all neighbours of a vertex


For performing BFS we need to know which vertices we have
visite and which vertices are yet to be visited
So for that we take an array visited

We also need a queue data structure where we insert and
delete the vertices that is we perform the enqueue and
dequeue operations.,

void BFS(int i)
{
	int u:
	printf("%d",i);
	visited[i]=1;
	enqueue(q,i);
	while(!isEmpty(q))
	{
		u=dequeue(q);
		for(v=1;v<=n;v++)
		{
			if(A[u][v]==1 && visited[v]==0)
			{
				printf(%d,v);
				visited[v]=1;
				enqueue(q,v);
			}
		}
 	}
}
