VECTORS



This is a C Program to implement Vectors. An array (vector) i
s a common-place data type, used to hold and describe a colle
ction of elements. These elements can be fetched at runtime b
y one or more indices (identifying keys). A distinguishing fe
ature of an array compared to a list is that they allow for c
onstant-time random access lookup, compared to the latters se
quential access. Resizable arrays allow for an unspecified up
per-bound of collection elements at runtime, and are conceptu
ality similar to a list. These dynamic arrays are more compli
cated and less used in introduction to its compatriot list, w
hich is dynamic by nature. Using C as the language of impleme
ntation this post will guide you through building a simple ve
ctor data-structure. The structure will take advantage of a f
ixed-size array, with a counter invariant that keeps track of
 how many elements are currently present. If the underlying a
rray becomes exhausted, the addition operation will re-alloca
te the contents to a larger size, by way of a copy.


Here is source code of the C Program to Implement Vector. The
 C program is successfully compiled and run on a Linux system
. The program output is also shown below.
