Array as abstract data types(adt)

-adt :means representation of data and the set of operation
	ont the data
-array is a basic data structure provided by almost every
	programming language
-so representation of data is defined by the compiler itself
-but operations on the data structure need to be given by us


Data
-array space
-size
-length(no of elements)
 Note: by length of array we mean that it need not
	be that the entire array size is always 
	occupied there can be spaces which are 
	unoccupied,so length of arrray is no of 
	elements occupying the array

Operations
-display()
-add(x)/append(x)
-insert(index,x)
-delete(index)
-search(x)
-get(index)
-set(index,x)
-max()/min()
-reverse(
-shift()/rotate()


int a[10];
//here we need to specify the size of array
 at the time of creation itself

int *a;
a=new int[size];
//this method allows you to create the array
 in heap without specifying the array space
 and the desired space can be specified later
