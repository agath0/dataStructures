SORTING TECHNIQUES


Criteria for analysis

-no.of comparisons
-no.of swaps
-Adaptive
-Stable
-extra memory


Types of sorting

1-Bubble               
2-Insertion
3-Selection
4-Heap Sort
5-Merge Sort
6-Quick Sort
7-Tree Sort
8-Shell Sort
9-Count Sort
10-Bucket / Bin Sort
11-Radix Sort


1 to 8 techniques are known as Comparison based sorts
9 to 11 techniques are known as Index based sorts

1 to 3 techniques take O(n**2) times 
4 to 7 techniques take O(nlog(n)) times 
9 to 11 techniques take O(n) times but huge space used


8 th technique take O(n**(3/2)) time
	so its faster than O(n**2) but 



Stable
if a sorting algorithm is preserving the 
order of duplicate elements in the socket list
