//Binary Heap as Priority Queue
//Elements will have their priority and they are
//inserted along with their priority.Then when we are deleeting
//always the highest priority element will be deleted
//
//Exmaple:
//
//Larger the element higher the priority
//you can use max heap to do this
//
//Heap is the best possible data structure for implementing
//priority queues
//And it takes only O(log(n)) for insertion 
//and O(log(n)) for deletion
//
//Else you can implement it simply using an array
//but it will take O(1) for insertion
//and n+n=2n that is O(n) for deletion
